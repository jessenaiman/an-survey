If you are thinking about purchasing new equipment you might consider doing it **​​before prices go up** substantially - why ? Much of the equipment is made in China but comes to Canada via USA from our suppliers. These suppliers are subject to new extreme tariffs imposed by the American government and  they will pass on their increased costs to consumers.  We are checking current pricing now on a per order basis .  
  
**If you are looking for some great pricing on brand new   [laser levels,](laser-levels.html) [levels,](site-pro-auto-level.html) [theodolites](dt8-05lp-5-sec-digital-theodolite-with-laser-plummet.html), and [total stations](index.html) for 2025 you have come to the right place!**

**Higher Performance with a Lower Price Tag**  
The RL-SV2S is Topcon’s newest construction laser! Following in a long line of superior quality laser transmitters, the RL-SV2S is a dual slope, long range, self-leveling instrument built to outperform all of its competitors.  
This laser is a great tool for any general construction or engineering project and designed for use for flat work, single or dual slope applications. Slopes up to +/\_ 15 degrees can be used in either the X or Y axis. With a 2,400 foot (diameter) operating range, the RL-SV2S has the power to cover even the biggest job sites.  
That’s not all! Turn the RL-SV2S on its side and use it for layout and alignment. Lay it down on the built-on mount or attach it to a tripod and the laser will electronically self-level for fast and accurate vertical applications. This multi-use laser does just about everything.

*   Long Range Operation (800m)
*   Horizontal, Multi-Slope & Vertical Applications
*   Extra Long Battery Life (120 hours)
*   Tough IP66 Construction Rating
*   Bluetooth for Remote Control
