​Dave White’s SitePro introduces an electronic self-leveling rotary lasers big in performance, simple leveling with precision and durability – the New SLR300H Self-Leveling Rotary Laser.  
The SLR300H is fully electronic with accuracy up to 1/8-in at 100-ft (3mm at 30m) and working range up to 1000-ft (300m) diameter. Self leveling range is up to +/- 5° with built-in sensor to indicate out-of-level condition and ensure accuracy.  
For simple grade jobs, the SLR300H is equipped with dual manual slope capability up to +/- 8.77% in both axis’. Smart H.I. alert system alerts user when laser has been moved or disturbed from its self leveling position. Enclosed rotor housing keeps laser beacon safe from all elements (IP54) and provides protection for tough jobsite conditions. The SLR300H is ideal for exterior applications with single 650nm laser beam.  
The SLR300H is powered with four ‘C’ alkaline batteries. Kit includes the RD300 laser detector with clamp, alkaline battery tray, batteries, and carrying case.

The SLR200HV features horizontal and vertical electronic self-leveling laser for precise leveling applications, ideal for both indoor and outdoor use. Vertical laydown positioning provides vertical alignment capabilities and squaring to ensure that walls or partitions are precisely aligned.

*   Manual Mode allows laser to tilted for simple slope applications
*   Smart H.I. Alert System alerts user when laser has been disturbed
*   Variable rotation speeds for a wide variety of jobsite visibility settings: 0, 60, 300 and 600RPM
*   Scan Angles: 10°, 45°, 90°, 180°; for maximum visibility
*   Visible 90-degree layout beams (both up and down plumb) for alignment and squaring to ensure that walls or partitions are precisely aligned
*   Clock-wise and counter-clock-wise beam positioning
*   Enclosed Rotor Housing keeps laser safe from tough jobsite conditions
*   Windy Mode Feature allows laser to level at jobsites with high winds or vibrations
