With the added Slope and Plumb Indicators, your grading and excavating accuracies are tighter than ever with Topcon's LS-B110. Plus, the new LS-B 110 enables you to offset the "on-grade " position with one touch. This gives you an even greater working range. Compatible with Topcon's family of Control Boxes for all your earth moving equipment the LS-B110 can also be used in "automatic" mode to hydraulically control the elevation and/or the slope of the cutting edge. This takes your production and materials savings up to a whole new level.

**RD-100W**  
  
The Remote Display puts the Laser Sensors information in the cab of the machine. Productivity increases on the job because the operator focuses on the grade information and not the Sensor itself. The operator can adjust the "On Grade" position without leaving the seat. No need to climb down to adjust the laser height or move the Sensor on the machine. Whether you are going deep with your excavator or grading with a drag scraper the RD-100W is wirelessly connected to the LS-B110W giving the operator constant, real time grade information.
