**RD-100W**  
  
The Remote Display puts the Laser Sensors information in the cab of the machine. Productivity increases on the job because the operator focuses on the grade information and not the Sensor itself. The operator can adjust the "On Grade" position without leaving the seat. No need to climb down to adjust the laser height or move the Sensor on the machine. Whether you are going deep with your excavator or grading with a drag scraper the RD-100W is wirelessly connected to the LS-B110W giving the operator constant, real time grade information.
