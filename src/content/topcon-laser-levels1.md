**Higher Performance with a Lower Price Tag**  
The RL-SV2S is Topcon’s newest construction laser! Following in a long line of superior quality laser transmitters, the RL-SV2S is a dual slope, long range, self-leveling instrument built to outperform all of its competitors.  
  
This laser is a great tool for any general construction or engineering project and designed for use for flat work, single or dual slope applications. Slopes up to +/\_ 15 degrees can be used in either the X or Y axis. With a 2,400 foot (diameter) operating range, the RL-SV2S has the power to cover even the biggest job sites.  
That’s not all! Turn the RL-SV2S on its side and use it for layout and alignment. Lay it down on the built-on mount or attach it to a tripod and the laser will electronically self-level for fast and accurate vertical applications. This multi-use laser does just about everything.  
But wait, there’s more! This versatile construction tool is loaded with all the features contractors love including long battery life (100 hrs/alkaline and 60hrs/ rechargeable Ni/MH), height of instrument alert, a dual sided detector, and electronic shutters. All of these features (and others) can be accessed on the front control panel or on a remote control devise which comes standard.  
  
Features:

*   Long Range Operation (800m)
*   Horizontal, Multi-Slope & Vertical Applications
*   Extra Long Battery Life (120 hours)
*   Tough IP66 Construction Rating
*   Remote Control Bluetooth to smartphone or tablet 
*   LS-100D receiver 

**Multi-Use Applications**:  
Designed for multiple types of tasks, the RL-SV2S can be used for horizontal, sloping and vertical laser applications. Slopes up to +/- 15 degrees can be used in either the X or Y axis. Turn it on its side and use it for layout and alignment jobs.  
  
**High Powered**:  
With an operating range of over 800m (diameter) the RL-SV2S has the power to cover even the biggest projects.  
  
**Long Battery Life**:  
Contractors who want a laser with a long battery life will love the RL-SV2S. Available with Alkaline Dry Battery Pack or with Rechargeable Battery Pack. With an operating time of 120 hours on alkaline batteries or 65 hours with the rechargeable Ni-MH battery pack this laser will still be working long after others have quit.  
  
**All Weather Dependability**:  
With the IP66 rating, the RL-SV2S is “jobsite tough” and can withstand dust, a sudden shower and even torrential rainfall.
